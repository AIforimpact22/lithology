# Lithology Viewer

A lightweight Flask application that surfaces lithology sections from the repository and
provides direct links to the associated PDF documents.

## Getting started

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the
   lithology dashboard.

The PDF links open in a new tab and are backed by the files bundled with this repository.
